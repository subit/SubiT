class ProviderNames(object):
	"""
	The class holds the names of all the subtitles providers that SubiT uses. 
	This is the only place in which the provider name is typed directly. In any
	other place, a reference to this class will be present.

	The name of the provider is usually its lower-cased fully qualified DNS 
	name, i.e., "www.torec.net".
